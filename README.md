# 🎭Textual-Emotion-Detection

This project focuses on text-based emotion recognition using Machine Learning and NLP techniques. The goal is to classify textual data into seven distinct emotions—Joy, Fear, Anger, Sadness, Disgust, Shame, and Guilt—by leveraging various machine learning classifiers.

# 🔍 Overview
This project explores various machine learning techniques to analyze and classify emotions from textual data. It includes:

Feature Extraction: Utilizes n-grams, CountVectorizer, and DictVectorizer for effective text representation.
Machine Learning Models: Implements and compares three classifiers:
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Decision Tree Classifier
Dataset: Uses an emotion-labeled dataset from Kaggle.
Performance Analysis: Evaluates accuracy, generalization, and interpretability of models.
Visualization: Includes classification results, confusion matrices, and performance metrics.

# 🚀 Future Enhancements
Integrating Deep Learning models (LSTMs, BERT, ROBERTA) for improved contextual understanding. 

Real-time emotion detection for applications like mental health monitoring and chatbot services.

Expanding to multilingual emotion recognition for a broader audience.
