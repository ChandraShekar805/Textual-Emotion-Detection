# 🎭Textual-Emotion-Detection

This project focuses on text-based emotion recognition using Machine Learning and NLP techniques. The goal is to classify textual data into seven distinct emotions—Joy, Fear, Anger, Sadness, Disgust, Shame, and Guilt—by leveraging various machine learning classifiers.

# 🔍 Overview
Feature Extraction: 
  - Uses n-grams, CountVectorizer, and DictVectorizer for feature representation.</br>
Machine Learning Models: 
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Decision Tree Classifier </br>
Dataset:
  - Emotion-labeled dataset from Kaggle </br>
Performance Analysis:
  - Compares model accuracy, generalization, and interpretability.</br>
Visualization:
  - Emotion classification results, confusion matrices, and performance metrics.

# 🚀 Future Enhancements
Integrating Deep Learning models (LSTMs, BERT, ROBERTA) for improved contextual understanding. 

Real-time emotion detection for applications like mental health monitoring and chatbot services.

Expanding to multilingual emotion recognition for a broader audience.
